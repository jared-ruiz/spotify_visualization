# Learning Log ðŸ“š
### General Project Goals

- Explore my Spotify data dating back well within 2024 to current 2025 listening
- Learn best practice when handling data like this, utilizing SQL, Pandas, Tableau and other libraries as needed
- End project with a clean Tableau visualization

Along the way, I will document all the sources and information I pull from to better help my learning experience. I am a visual learner and will link to particular videos and articles throughout the entirety of this document. 

# Day 0 Initial Set Up

I begin my project by cloning my empty repo to my local setup, creating a gitignore file and adding in my newly downloaded json data. This data seems to be formatted pretty standard. I learned recently about [New Line Delimited JSON Format](https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/latest/dataweave-formats-ndjson) when playing around with some other data and realized there is a bit more set up involved when handling it. 

I also created a [Python Virtual Environment](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_virtualenv.asp) to house any unique dependencies utilized in this project.

## Quick Cheat Sheet For Handling venv Activation:
### Create venv:
> python -m venv [chosen name of venv directory]
### Activate venv:
> [chosen name of venv directory]\Scripts\activate
### Deactivate venv:
> deactivate
### Delete venv
> rmdir /s /q [chosen name of venv directory]

## Initial Data Handling
I have been researching the distinction between using pandas and sqlite for a few days and I think the consensus is I am to use both, pandas would be good for preprocessing the data before pushing it into sqlite for further querying. 

With that being said, I wanted to do a quick crash course on pandas and how it will work for me in this project. 

To test out pandas right out the gate, I wrote up something simple like this:

```
# acquire json title
data_file = input("Please provide your data file for utilization: ")

# handle quick user enter input
if len(data_file) < 3:
    data_file = 'json_data/StreamingHistory_music_0.json'
    df = pd.read_json(data_file)
    print(df)
        
else:
    print('file name not detected.')
```

This outputted a condensed table within my terminal like this:
```
Please provide your data file for utilization:

From here I referenced the pandas documentation to then get introduced to [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame)
